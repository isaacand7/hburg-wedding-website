            Investing in a wedding film is a big decision, and it's normal to
            have questions. Here are honest, straightforward answers to the
            most common things couples ask about working with me. If you don't
            see your question here, I'm always happy to chat by email at
            <a href="mailto:isaacwandreas@gmail.com"

              <p class="faq-answer">
                Once you reach out with your date, venue, and a few details,
                I'll confirm availability and send over a custom proposal with
                collection options. If you're ready to move forward, I'll send
                a simple online agreement and invoice. Your date is officially
                reserved once the agreement is signed and the retainer is paid.
                Until that point, your date remains open to other inquiries.

            <!-- Turnaround time -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                What is your typical turnaround time?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                My standard turnaround time for highlight films is
                <strong>6–10 weeks</strong>, depending on the time of year and
                how many weddings I'm editing. I don't rush your film—I carefully
                sort footage, sync audio, and build your story so it actually
                feels like your day. If you're getting married in peak season,
                I'll give you a more specific estimate in your proposal. When
                your film is ready, you'll receive a private online gallery you
                can download and share with friends and family.

            <!-- Travel fees -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                Do you charge travel fees?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                For weddings in and around <strong>Harrisonburg, VA</strong> and
                much of the Shenandoah Valley, I typically
                <strong>don't charge additional travel fees</strong>. For
                weddings farther away—especially out-of-state or requiring
                overnight stays—there may be a reasonable travel fee to cover
                mileage, lodging, or airfare. I'll always be upfront about any
                travel costs in your proposal so there are no surprises later.

            <!-- Music licensing -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                How do you handle music licensing?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                I legally license all of the music I use in your wedding film
                through professional licensing platforms. That means your film
                is cleared to be shared online without takedowns or copyright
                issues. I carefully choose songs that fit your story and the
                overall feel of your day. Because of licensing laws, I usually
                can't use popular Top 40 songs or specific radio tracks, but
                I'll work within those guidelines to choose music that still
                feels modern and emotional.

            <!-- Drone policy -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                What is your drone policy?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                When conditions and local regulations allow, I love incorporating
                tasteful aerial footage to showcase your venue and setting.
                Drone use always depends on <strong>weather, venue rules, and
                FAA regulations</strong>. Some locations restrict drone flights
                or require specific permissions, and I always follow those rules
                for everyone's safety. If drone coverage is important to you,
                let me know in your inquiry and I'll let you know what's
                possible for your venue.

            <!-- Payment schedule -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                What does your payment schedule look like?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                To reserve your date, I require a
                <strong>non‑refundable retainer</strong> (a percentage of your
                total collection), with the remaining balance typically due
                <strong>two weeks before your wedding day</strong>. Payments are
                made securely online, and you're welcome to split the remaining
                balance into additional installments if that's helpful—as long
                as everything is paid before the wedding. Full details are
                outlined clearly in your agreement.

            <!-- What if you're sick -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                What happens if you're sick or have an emergency?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                Your wedding day is a once‑in‑a‑lifetime event, and I take that
                responsibility seriously. If I'm dealing with a minor illness,
                I will still plan to be there and take appropriate precautions.
                In the unlikely event of a serious illness or true emergency
                that prevents me from filming, I will do everything I can to
                arrange a <strong>trusted replacement filmmaker</strong> with a
                similar style and experience level. In that case, I would still
                handle the editing so your final film feels like my work. If a
                replacement can't be found, you would receive a refund according
                to the terms in our agreement.

            <!-- Film length -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                How long are your wedding films?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                It depends on the collection you choose, but most couples
                receive a <strong>5–8 minute highlight film</strong> that tells
                the story of their day in a cinematic, shareable way. Longer
                documentary edits—such as a full ceremony or full speeches—can
                often be added on. During the booking process, we'll talk about
                what you value most (vows, speeches, dancing, letters, etc.) so
                we can choose the right length and edit style for you.
