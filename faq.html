          <p class="faq-intro">
            Investing in a wedding film is a big decision, and it's normal to
            have questions. Here are honest, straightforward answers to the
            most common things couples ask about working with me. If you don't
            see your question here, I'm always happy to chat by email at
            <a href="mailto:isaacwandreas@gmail.com"
              >isaacwandreas@gmail.com</a

              <h3 class="faq-question">How does booking work?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                Once you reach out with your date, venue, and a few details,
                I'll confirm availability and send over a custom proposal with
                collection options. If you're ready to move forward, I'll send
                a simple online agreement and invoice. Your date is officially
                reserved once the agreement is signed and the retainer is paid.
                Until that point, your date remains open to other inquiries.

            <!-- Turnaround time -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                What is your typical turnaround time?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                My standard turnaround time for highlight films is
                <strong>6–10 weeks</strong>, depending on the time of year and
                how many weddings I'm editing. I don't rush your film—I carefully
                sort footage, sync audio, and build your story so it actually
                feels like your day. If you're getting married in peak season,
                I'll give you a more specific estimate in your proposal. When
                your film is ready, you'll receive a private online gallery you
                can download and share with friends and family.

            <!-- Travel fees -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                Do you charge travel fees?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                <strong>Travel within 30 minutes of Harrisonburg, VA is included</strong> in your package. For weddings beyond 30 minutes, I charge <strong>$0.75 per mile</strong> (round trip). I'm always upfront about travel in your quote so there are no surprises.

            <!-- Music licensing -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                How do you handle music licensing?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                I legally license all of the music I use in your wedding film
                through professional licensing platforms. That means your film
                is cleared to be shared online without takedowns or copyright
                issues. I carefully choose songs that fit your story and the
                overall feel of your day. Because of licensing laws, I usually
                can't use popular Top 40 songs or specific radio tracks, but
                I'll work within those guidelines to choose music that still
                feels modern and emotional.

            <!-- Drone policy -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                What is your drone policy?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                <strong>Drone aerials are included with all packages.</strong> When weather and local regulations allow, I incorporate tasteful aerial footage to showcase your venue. I always follow FAA rules and venue requirements. If your venue has specific restrictions, we can discuss options in advance.

            <!-- Payment schedule -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                What does your payment schedule look like?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                A <strong>25% non-refundable retainer</strong> is required to secure your wedding date. The <strong>remaining balance is due 30 days before the wedding</strong>. Dates are reserved on a first-come, first-served basis upon receipt of the retainer and signed contract. If for any unforeseen reason I need to cancel before your wedding date, you receive a <strong>100% refund</strong> of all payments made.

                What happens if you're sick or have an emergency?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                Your wedding day is a once‑in‑a‑lifetime event, and I take that
                responsibility seriously. If for any unforeseen reason I need to
                cancel before your wedding date, you receive a
                <strong>100% refund</strong> of all payments made. I'll do everything
                possible to be there—and if I can't, you're fully protected.

            <!-- Film length -->
            <article class="faq-item">
              <h3 class="faq-question">
                How long are your wedding films?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                It depends on the collection you choose, but most couples
                receive a <strong>5–8 minute highlight film</strong> that tells
                the story of their day in a cinematic, shareable way. Longer
                documentary edits—such as a full ceremony or full speeches—can
                often be added on. During the booking process, we'll talk about
                what you value most (vows, speeches, dancing, letters, etc.) so
                we can choose the right length and edit style for you.
